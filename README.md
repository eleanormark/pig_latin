In this project, I experimented with Regular Expressions and different methods in Ruby's `String` class for queries and manipulation.  The `split` method is used to split an incoming sentence into multiple words.  I used Rubular to put together a regex to test whether each word starts with a set of consonate cluster or 'qu'. The `match` and `gsub` methods are used to capture, extract and append the substing to the end of the word.
